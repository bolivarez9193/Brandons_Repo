For some reason, changing the sorting title is not working.
I have tested if sortingTitle is being read by the findAll function
It is being read, so I have no idea why it isn't working
However, if you were to change the value of sortingTitle from ASC to DESC, it will work.

Also, I cannot figure out how to use multiple strings to search.
I got it to where it will find and display the correct search results for one word searching.
However, if the user enters multiple words, nothing will display.
Unless of course if you use two words or characters that are exactly spaced in your search terms that are in the name and description.
