Ok so this was a little late. Oh well, everything is pretty much done. I even included the link back to the homepage. 

However, I was a little confused beginning this assignment due to the number of models we needed. We needed three including the DB.php,
but I decided to do four models, so i can make it look better. The other model includes the other details of each recipe.
Therefore, the models are as follows,

Recipe.php
RecipeSteps.php
RecipeDetails.php
DB.php

This was because, if I had tried to join the steps table along with the other details, each detail would be repeated over and over again.
Therefore, I made the details model to fix this problem by separating them into two SQL statements. This worked out perfectly on my end.
I have also included the database itself in the root. Anyway, sorry I couldn't get it done in three models only.
