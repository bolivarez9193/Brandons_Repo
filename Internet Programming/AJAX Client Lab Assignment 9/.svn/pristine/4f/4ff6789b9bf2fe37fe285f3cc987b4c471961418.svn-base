Okay, so I tried to test out the php for getting every ingredient, and it works great. I also tested adding an ingredient, and it works fine.
I still need to try out the ajax call to get the list of ingredients, but I'm not entirely sure how to do that. 
I probably won't finish this by the due date, but I will keep working at this assignment during the semester.
I didn't work with a partner for this one, but I will keep trying to do this on my own.
Anyway, sorry for the crappy submission. I'll try to do better next time.
