<h2>Client-side testing page</h2>

<p>Shouldn't have to change this page, except to add your JavaScript. On load, hook that normal select box to populate it and give it your advanced functionality.</p>

<p>You could put the hidden dialogue on the page here, but to make the widget as easy to use as possible, we're going to programmatically create it instead.</p>

<form method="POST" action="">
	<select name="ingredient" id="ingredient-dropdown"></select>
	<button>Post Me</button>
</form>

<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="ingredients.js"></script>
<script>cool_ingredients_widget($("#ingredient-dropdown"))</script>
</body>
