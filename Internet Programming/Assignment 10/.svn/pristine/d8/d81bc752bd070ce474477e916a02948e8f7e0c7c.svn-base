Okay well I managed to get pretty much everything working great! The only thing I haven't been able to test is whether I can get to the
admin content on the content.php page. I was however able to get login.php and signup.php working just fine! 

The bad thing about my code is the fact that the signup.php controller checks for empty text boxes on the controller itself rather 
than the user model. I did get the password verification, and the login verfication errors to work in the model. I also checked if
the username was already taken in the database. All the errors work, but the empty textbox errors are in the signup.php controller 
rather than the model. 

Overall, I think I did okay. Not great, but okay.
